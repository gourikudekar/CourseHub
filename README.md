## CourseHub – SQL-Based Learning Platform

**CourseHub** is a real-life inspired SQL project that simulates a professional learning management system. It manages trainers, courses, and learners, integrating key concepts of relational databases, analytics, and backend logic using MySQL. This project is ideal for portfolio building, academic submission, or demonstrating backend SQL skills in interviews.

 ## Database Schema
- **trainer**  
  Stores trainer details with expertise, years of experience, and rating.
- **course**  
  Contains course information including fees and learning mode (online/offline).
- **learner**  
  Tracks enrolled learners with scores, contact information, and links to both trainers and courses.
- **Constraints Applied**  
  `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `ENUM`

##  Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL** – Core relational database system
- **MySQL Workbench** – SQL query execution and schema visualization
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** – For DDL, DML, Joins, Views, Procedures
- **ER Modeling & Constraints** – Normalized database design with integrity constraints

##  Task Breakdown

## Task 1 – Database & Table Design  
Structured the schema using proper relational modeling with constraints to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Task 2 – Data Insertion & Logical Updates  
Inserted realistic data and applied logic-based updates such as domain replacement, fee adjustments, and experience boosts.

## Task 3 – Data Retrieval & Filtering  
Filtered and retrieved meaningful insights based on learner scores, course fees, and trainer ratings.

## Task 4 – Subqueries & Aggregated Insights  
Used subqueries and aggregates to compare individual records with overall statistics, identifying top performers and trends.

## Task 5 – Joins for Relationship Exploration  
Utilized INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER joins to explore relationships between learners, courses, and trainers.

## Task 6 – Grouping & Reporting  
Grouped data for summaries such as learner count, average scores, and experience distribution.

## Task 7 – Views for Reusable Reports  
Created views for trainer performance, course popularity, and learner directories to simplify frequent analysis.

## Task 8 – Stored Procedures & Functions  
Automated key actions like adding learners, enrolling in courses, rating updates, and score-based cleanups using procedures and functions.


##  Features
- Realistic and normalized database structure  
- Clean and validated data entries  
- Dynamic reporting through joins, subqueries, and aggregation  
- Business-ready views for performance summaries and fee insights  
- Reusable stored procedures and custom logic via functions  
- Error handling and conditional execution built-in  

##  How to Run
1. Open **MySQL Workbench** or any compatible SQL editor.  
2. Run the **database creation** and **table scripts** provided.  
3. Insert sample data using the **insertion queries**.  
4. Execute update, select, and join queries for insights.  
5. Use **views** and **stored procedures** to test automation and reporting.

## Conclusion
CourseHub is a comprehensive, real-world SQL project that encapsulates the full lifecycle of a learning management system. From data modeling and structured insertion to validation, reporting, and automation, it demonstrates practical applications of SQL in a clean and organized format. Whether you're a student exploring database concepts, a data analyst handling structured information, or a backend developer building robust systems — this project highlights essential SQL skills through a realistic and meaningful use case.
